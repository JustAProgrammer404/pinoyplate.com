		<h1> Crispy Pata </h1>

		<p class="article-desc">
		  Crispy Pata is a Filipino dish consisting of deep-fried whole pork leg (pata) that has been pre
		  boiled and seasoned. The goal is to achieve extremely tender meat on the inside and incredibly 
		  crisp, crackling skin on the outside. It is usually served with a dipping sauce of vinegar, soy 
		  sauce, garlic, and chili peppers.

		<h2>Cooking Procedure</h2>

		<ol class="procedure-list">
		  <li><strong>Boil the Pata.</strong><br>In a large pot, place the whole pork leg and cover it with water. Add the onion, crushed garlic, 
													bay leaves, peppercorns, salt, vinegar, and soy sauce.</li>
		  <li><strong>Tenderize.</strong><br>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 2 to 3 hours, or until the 
												pork leg is very tender. Alternatively, use a pressure cooker for about 45 minutes.</li>
		  <li><strong>Drain and Dry.</strong><br>Remove the pork leg from the liquid and drain it well. Pat the skin completely dry with paper 
													towels. </li>
		  <li><strong>Season the Skin.</strong><br>Rub the entire skin of the pork leg generously with salt.</li>
		  <li><strong>Chill.</strong><br>Refrigerate the pork leg uncovered for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. Chilling and 
											drying the skin helps achieve the ultimate crispiness.</li>
		  <li><strong>Deep Fry.</strong><br>In a deep cooking pot or wok, heat enough cooking oil for deep frying over medium-high heat. 
											Carefully lower the pork leg into the hot oil.</li>
		  <li><strong>Achieve Crispiness.</strong><br>Fry the pork leg for 15 to 20 minutes, turning it constantly, until the skin is bubbly, golden 
														brown, and perfectly crisp.</li>
		  <li><strong>Rest and Serve.</strong><br>Remove the Crispy Pata from the oil and drain excess grease. Let it rest for 5-10 minutes before 
													chopping into serving pieces. Serve immediately with the prepared dipping sauce.</li>
