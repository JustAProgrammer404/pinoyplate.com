		<h1>Lechon Kawali</h1>

		<p class="article-desc">
		  Lechon Kawali is another crispy pork belly dish, similar to Crispy Pata but using a slab of pork 
		  belly (liempo). The meat is first boiled in a seasoned liquid until tender, then air-dried, and 
		  finally deep-fried in a wok (kawali) until the skin becomes blistered and unbelievably crisp. It is 
		  a faster alternative to traditional Lechon.

		<h2>Cooking Procedure</h2>

		<ol class="procedure-list">
		  <li><strong>Boil the Pork.</strong><br>In a large pot, place the pork belly. Add water, onion, garlic, salt, peppercorns, and bay leaves. 
											Bring to a boil.</li>
		  <li><strong>Tenderize.</strong><br>Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the pork belly is fork
										tender.</li>
		  <li><strong>Drain and Dry.</strong><br>Remove the pork belly from the broth and place it on a wire rack. Pat the skin completely dry 
											with paper towels.</li>
		  <li><strong>Air-Dry and Chill.</strong><br>Rub a little salt on the skin. Air-dry and chill the pork belly uncovered in the refrigerator for at 
												least 3 hours or, ideally, overnight. This step is essential for maximum crispiness.</li>
		  <li><strong>Deep Fry (First Fry).</strong><br>Heat enough oil in a deep pan or kawali over medium heat. Fry the pork belly (skin-side down 
												first) for about 10-15 minutes until the skin is lightly browned and hard. Remove and drain.</li>
		  <li><strong>Deep Fry (Second Fry/High Heat).</strong><br>Increase the heat to high. Once the oil is smoking hot, carefully return the pork belly to the oil. 
																Fry quickly for 3 to 5 minutes, turning occasionally, until the skin blisters and achieves that 
																characteristic bubbly crispiness.</li>
		  <li><strong>Serve</strong><br>Remove from the oil, drain excess fat, and let it rest briefly. Chop the crispy pork belly into 
									serving pieces and serve hot with Lechon sauce.</li>
