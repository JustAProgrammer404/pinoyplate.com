		<h2>Cooking Procedure</h2>

		<ol class="procedure-list">
		  <li><strong>Clean the meat.</strong><br>Rinse the oxtail and beef pieces under running water. Remove impurities and drain well.</li>
		  <li><strong>Boil and tenderize the meat.</strong><br>Place the meat in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, skim off scum, 
															then add onion and garlic. Lower heat and simmer 2–3 hours (or pressure cook 35–45 minutes) 
															until very tender.  </li>
		  <li><strong>Prepare the vegetables. </strong><br>Slice the eggplants, cut the sitaw, and wash the pechay. Set them aside separately.</li>
		  <li><strong>Blanch the vegetables.</strong><br>In boiling water, blanch the sitaw for 1 minute, remove, then blanch eggplants and pechay. 
													  Arrange them on a tray for later use.</li>
		  <li><strong> Start the peanut sauce.</strong><br>In a large pan, heat oil over medium heat. Sauté minced garlic, then add annatto powder or 
														annatto water and mix until the color is released.</li>
		  <li><strong>Add the peanut component.</strong><br>Add peanut butter (or ground peanuts) to the pan. Stir until smooth, then ladle in 2–3 cups of hot 
														 broth from the meat pot. Mix until a thick sauce forms.</li>
		  <li><strong>Thicken with toasted rice.</strong><br>Add ground toasted rice (or cornstarch slurry) to adjust the thickness. Stir continuously to avoid 
														  lumps.</li>
		  <li><strong>Combine meat and sauce.</strong><br>Transfer the tender meat pieces into the peanut sauce. Add more broth if necessary to get a 
													   creamy consistency.</li>
		  <li><strong>Simmer the stew.</strong><br>Cook over low heat for 10–15 minutes so the meat absorbs the peanut flavor.</li>
		  <li><strong>Add the vegetables.</strong><br>Place the sitaw, eggplant, and pechay on top of the stew. Cover and let them heat for 2–3 
												   minutes without overcooking.</li>
		  <li><strong>Season lightly.</strong><br>Add salt only if needed. Kare-Kare is intentionally mild because bagoong provides the main 
											   seasoning.</li>
		  <li><strong>Serve.</strong><br>Transfer the stew to a serving bowl, keeping vegetables arranged neatly on top. Serve hot with 
									  bagoong alamang on the side. </li>
