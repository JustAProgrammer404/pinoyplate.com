		<h1>Igado</h1>

		<p class="article-desc">
		  Igado is a popular Ilocano dish made primarily of pork tenderloin and pig's internal organs, 
		  specifically liver and sometimes kidneys. It is stewed in a savory and slightly tangy sauce 
		  composed of vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce (patis), garlic, onion, and various vegetables like 
		  carrots and bell peppers. It is known for its distinctive blend of flavors and textures.

	  <!-- PROCEDURE -->
	  <section class="article-section">
		<h2>Cooking Procedure</h2>

		<ol class="procedure-list">
		  <li><strong>Marinate the Liver.</strong>Marinate the sliced pig liver in 2 tablespoons of vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper for about 
												10 minutes. This helps remove the "gamey" taste.</li>
		  <li><strong>Sauté Aromatics.</strong>In a large pot or wok, heat cooking oil. Sauté the chopped onion and minced garlic until fragrant.</li>
		  <li><strong>Cook the Pork.</strong>Add the pork tenderloin strips and stir-fry until the meat is lightly browned. Season with pepper.</li>
		  <li><strong>Add Liquids.</strong>Pour in the soy sauce and remaining vinegar. Allow the vinegar to boil for 2–3 minutes before 
											stirring (this helps cook out the harshness). Add the water and fish sauce. Bring to a boil.</li>
		  <li><strong>Simmer.</strong>Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the pork simmer for 10–15 minutes until the meat 
									is tender.</li>
		  <li><strong>Add Vegetables.</strong>Add the carrots and liver (drained from its marinade) to the pot. Stir gently and cook for about 5 
											minutes until the liver is cooked through. Avoid overcooking the liver as it can become tough.</li>
		  <li><strong>Finish the Dish.</strong>Add the green bell pepper strips and green peas (if using). Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, if 
												needed. Cook for another 3 minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp.</li>
		  <li><strong>Serve</strong>Transfer the Igado to a serving plate and serve hot with steamed rice.</li>
