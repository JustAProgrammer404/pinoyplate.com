		<h1>Dinuguan</h1>

		<p class="article-desc">
		  Dinuguan, often called Filipino Pork Blood Stew or "Chocolate Meat," is a savory and unique 
		  dish made from pork (usually offal and/or meat) stewed in a rich, dark gravy of fresh pig's blood, 
		  vinegar, and various spices like garlic, onion, and chili peppers. The vinegar keeps the blood 
		  from coagulating and provides the essential tangy taste. It is traditionally served with a side of 
		  Puto (steamed rice cake).

		<h2>Cooking Procedure</h2>

		<ol class="procedure-list">
		  <li><strong>Sauté Aromatics.</strong>Heat some oil in a pot. Sauté the minced onions, ginger, and garlic for a few minutes until light 
												brown and aromatic.</li>
		  <li><strong>Cook the Pork.</strong>Add the sliced pork pieces and sauté for around 5 minutes until the color is no longer pink. 
											Season with pepper.</li>
		  <li><strong>Add Liquid and Spices.</strong>Pour in the 1/2 cup of plain vinegar (do not stir immediately, let it boil for 2–3 minutes), then 
													add the bay leaves and water.</li>
		  <li><strong>Braise the Pork.</strong>Cover the pot and let the mixture simmer for 30 minutes, or until the pork is tender.</li>
		  <li><strong>Add the Blood.</strong>Pour in the blood mixture (pork blood mixed with vinegar). Stir gently and continue cooking 
										over low heat.</li>
		  <li><strong>Thicken the Sauce.</strong>Keep stirring gently and continuously for about 10–15 minutes until the sauce thickens to a 
												gravy-like consistency and the blood is fully cooked. Stirring prevents the blood from forming 
												lumps.</li>
		  <li><strong>Finish the Dish.</strong>Add the long green chilies. Season with salt and additional pepper. Stir gently and allow it to 
												simmer for 5 more minutes.</li>
		  <li><strong>Serve</strong>Turn off the heat. Transfer the Dinuguan to a serving bowl and serve hot with Puto or steamed 
									rice.</li>
